Intro
I created these components/objects in 2007 - based off some older Delphi code that I had laying around. It comes with everything - and was intentionally meant for Spades.
1. Cardsets (fronts and backs)
2. Card, Cardsets, Player, Deck components/objects.
3. Very early Tricks/betting routines - no AI (most likely I will remove these in the future)

What was the point:
What is the point of programming, generally speaking?
Reasons why I think I may have written this:
1. Challenge myself to write this in pure Winforms Controls/graphics? (I used to be proficient Delphi custom control programmer so, I generally know graphics handling)
2. Figure out if I could do it in C#.

Requirements:
1. Net client 2 - 4.6
2. Winforms (I have no doubt this should be easily 'portable' to WPF)


Future:
1. I will probably move these to .Net 6 if I have time.

How to use it:
1. Load it in Visual Studio
2. Compile
3. Run!
